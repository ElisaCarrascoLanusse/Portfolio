            <h2>I'm Elisa!</h2>
            <p>Hey there! I am <u>Elisa Carrasco Lanusse</u>, a Sociologist and UX Designer from Quito, Ecuador. Recently graduated from Grinnell College, Iâ€™m passionate about creating technology and <u>design that is respectful and inclusive</u> of all users. I believe that by <u>humanizing our designs and prioritizing accessibility</u>, we can create a <u>better</u> and more <u>equitable experience</u> for everyone.

            As someone who grew up in a country with a rich cultural diversity, I understand the importance of designing for a diverse audience and celebrating differences. I hope to use my skills and knowledge to create technology and design that is not only effective, but also <u>empathetic and inclusive</u>. Thank you for visiting my portfolio and learning more about my approach to design!</p>
