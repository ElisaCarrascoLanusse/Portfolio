# [Portfolio](https://elisacarrascolanusse.github.io/Portfolio/)

Hi, I'm Elisa!

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a sociologist with a passion for the creation and maintaining of public sociology and accessible design. I am also a "todera" and always looking for new projects and hobbies to work on, so feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate! I dabble some in drawing, writing, user-experience r&d, and starting on web-design :)

## Future To Do

- [ ] Fix header image (changes color when outside of the main page (index.html))
- [ ] Other projects carousel

## Project Structure

    index.html: Home page.
    about.html: About Me page.
    contact.html: Contact form.
    play.html: Non-work projects.
    work.html: Work projects.

    script.js: Handles the UI and fetch requests.

    style.css: Style sheet.
