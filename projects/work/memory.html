            <p class="text-lg my-5">During my time as a Sociology student at Grinnell College I got to collaborate with faculty and peers on meaningful research. One such project is "Memory Matters: A Comparative Analysis of the Commemoration, Memorialization, and Reconciliation Processes of Genocide in Rwanda, Bosnia, and Cambodia". Working with Meghna Adhikari, Ileah Bonzi, and Dr. Sharon Quinsaat we analyzed genocide memorial sites in order to answer the question: <i>How do different actors influence the framing of memorialization sites?</i></p>

            <p>The bulk of my research was on the case of the <b>1994 Rwandan (Tutsi) genocide (800,000 to 1 million people killed)</b>, specifically the <u><a class="text-hover-100" href="https://kgm.rw/">Kigali Genocide Memorial</a></u>. This specific site was chosen due to its location in the capital and role in the post-genocide reconciliation process and efforts. Starting with the historical and socio-political context, I was able to understand the ways in which colonial legacies directly impacted the Hutu majority's genocide of the Tutsi people. This was particularly helpful in understanding the conditions leading up to the genocide and the international response, or lack thereof in the face of such atrocities.</p>
            <p class="mt-4">After understanding the context, I analyzed the memorialization process. The Kigali Genocide Memorial was established in 2004 as a designated place for the mass graves of 250,000 residents murdered during the genocide. The site includes memorial gardens, a wall of names, graves, and the Genocide Archive of Rwanda. In actuality, it is a center for Rwandans and tourists alike to learn about the genocide, reconciliation, and peacebuilding. When analyzing collectively the memorial sites of each genocide, Meghna, Ileah and I came up with a framework to analyze memorial sites based on the degree of contextualization and perspective displayed.</p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-center mb-4">Proposed Framework</h2>          
            <p class="w-full text-justify font-large mb-4">The proposed framework is a comprehensive approach to analyzing memorial sites based on contextualization and point of view. The goal of this framework is to understand how the perspective and focus along with the level of contextualization impact how the space is built and maintained and its role in the community. The main variables are:</p>  
            <div class="bg-text text-neutral-800 p-16 rounded-2xl inset-shadow-neutral-400">
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside rounded-2xl inset-shadow-neutral-400">
                    <li class="my-2"><b>Contextualization</b>: The degree to which the memorial site provides historical, political, and social context on the genocide and the things being displayed.
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 text-md">
                            <li class="my-2"><b>Limited contextualization</b>: The memorial site provides little to no historical, political, or social context and the things being displayed.</li>
                            <li class="my-2"><b>Comprehensive contextualization</b>: The memorial site provides comprehensive historical, political, or social context on the genocide and the things being displayed.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li class="my-2"><b>Perspective</b>: The degree to which the memorial site provides multiple perspectives (e.g. victims, perpetrators, bystanders).
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 text-md">
                            <li class="my-2"><b>Victim Centered</b>: The main perspective and focus of the site is on the victims their families. This often manifests through a focus on grief and emotional processing of the loss.</li>
                            <li class="my-2"><b>Reconciliation Centered</b>: The main perspective and focus of the site is on reconciliation, education, and peace building. This often manifests through a focus on post-genocide societal reconstruction and awareness raising on a local and international level.</li>
                            <li class="my-2"><b>State-Centered</b>: The main perspective and focus of the site is on maintaining the official narrative of the post-genocide state. This often manifests through a focus on the version of history that best serves state interests. 
                            </li>
