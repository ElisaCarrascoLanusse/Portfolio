                <p>The <a href="https://www.iistl.org/"><u>International Institute of Saint Louis</u></a> is a key
                    resource for immigrants in Eastern Missouri. Among their other resources and efforts, they have an
                    Anti-Trafficking In Persons Program team that focuses on identifying and aiding victims of human
                    trafficking. As one of the only ATIP teams in St. Louis that works with labor trafficking victims,
                    my work with the team mainly focused on the creation of accessible resources for clients in English
                    and Spanish as well as the analysis and identification of trends in labor violation data.</p>

                    <p>Working with the ATIP team really allowed me to put into practice one of my key beliefs:
                        Prescriptive solutions can be more harmful than good, which is why data-based solutions are
                        essential in tackling social issues. During my time with the ATIP team I was able to identify,
                        clean, and analyze data official data sets on labor practices. <i>The goal of this analysis was
                            to bring light to some of the current trends in labor law violations, immigrant workers, and
                            the industries in which labor trafficking might be encountered and identify major labor law violators to look out for.</i> Specifically I looked at
                        the following resources:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc font-medium">
                        <li><a href="https://enforcedata.dol.gov/views/data_catalogs.php"><u>US Department of
                                    Labor</u></a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.uscis.gov/tools/reports-and-studies/immigration-and-citizenship-data"><u>US
                                    Citizenship and Immigration Services</u></a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.ncfh.org/index.html"><u>National Center for Farmworker Health</u></a>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 class="font-bold text-left py-4 text-lg">Data Cleaning</h2>
                    <p class="text-justify">After compiling the data, <i>R Studio</i> was used to process, clean, and analyze it in search of possible trends. The data was filtered by the following locations: <i>Saint Louis, Chesterfield, Clayton, Kirkwood Florissant, Saint Charles, O'fallon, Wentzville, Lake Saint Louis, Arnold, Festus, Hillsboro, and De Soto.</i> Due to the nature of the data, entries with NAs in key variables was excluded. This data goes up to 2024 and is not influenced by new labor and immigration laws of 2025.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="font-bold py-4 text-lg text-right">Analysis Methods</h2>
                    <p class="text-justify">As an initial exploratory approach, most of the descriptive analysis focuses on the relationships between two or more variables. Due to the nature of the data and the research objective, this is not meant to show or prove any causation, but rather explore possible correlations. It is divided into four sections: <i>Wage and Hour Violations, OSHA Violations, Foreign Labor Data, and H Visa Employer Data.</i></p>

        <!-- Wage and Hour Violations -->
         <section class="wage-violations w-/10 mx-auto flex flex-wrap">
            <div class="wage-violations-text w-14/17 mx-auto my-12">
                <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Wage and Hour Violations</h1>
                <p class="text-justify">Following the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Department of Labor has established guidelines and norms to ensure workers rights to fair wages. They conduct investigations on reports of discriminatory and illegal practices in all legitimate labor industries. The data was initially cleaned and filtered to focus on the <i>city and industry</i> as main variables, with the number of investigations and violations being examined for each. This is meant to highlight patterns in the wage and hour violations reported in different industries, pointing at particular spots that we want to keep an eye on. The analysis uses registered data from 2018 to 2024.</p>
