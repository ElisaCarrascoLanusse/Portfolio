            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>Since itâ€™s creation in 2014, Laboratoria has been consistently growing and adapting in their mission to provide tech education for low income women in Latin America. As part of this growth, a focus on community engagement has become vital. Through communications such as emails and newsletters, I  worked with the Partnerships team to improve the design of communications in order to foster engagement.</p>

                <h1>Understanding The Problem</h1>
                <p>Laboratoria's Partnerships team relies on their newsletter to maximize engagement and effectively communicate with current and potential donors and partners, including both corporations and individuals. Analysis of the las 7 newsletters suggests the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The average <u>open rate</u> was 28.10%</li>
                    <li>The average <u>click rate</u> was 5.50%</li>
                    <li>The average <u>unsubscribing rate</u> was 2.04%</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>Research</h1>
                <p>The research process begun by  defining the target audience. The Partnerships team works directly with donors and partners, so based on this I created three user personas:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Corporate Donor</li>
                    <li>Individual Donor</li>
                    <li>Partner Donor</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After defining the target audience, I conducted a survey to understand the current perception of the newsletter. The survey was sent to 100 current donors and partners, and the results were as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>60% of respondents found the newsletter "informative"</li>
                    <li>30% of respondents found the newsletter "engaging"</li>
                    <li>10% of respondents found the newsletter "confusing"</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
     </section>

    <!-- Solution -->
     <section class="solution">
        <h1>Solution</h1>
        <p>Based on the research, I worked on a new design for the newsletter. The design focused on improving the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Visual hierarchy</li>
            <li>Content organization</li>
            <li>Call to action</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="conclusion">
        <div id="laboratoria-background">

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>After implementing the new design, the newsletter saw an increase in engagement:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The average open rate increased to 35.10%</li>
            <li>The average click rate increased to 7.50%</li>
            <li>The average unsubscribing rate decreased to 1.04%</li>
