            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-left leading-loose">"Enamorarse es crear una religión cuyo dios es falible" - Jorge Luis Borges</h2>
            <p class="text-lg my-4">First conceived as part of a zine project for one of my art courses, Theology of Love delves into Borges' quote and explores the realities of love in the 21st century through five steps:</p>
            <ol class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-base font-bold" id="theology-list">
                <li>Belief in the supernatural</li>
                <li>The sacred and the profane</li>
                <li>Rituals</li>
                <li>Place of worship</li>
                <li>Prayer and other forms of communication</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-lg font-medium my-4">The project is meant to emulate a step by step manual to falling in love, and in the process creating a cult with a "fallible god". Delving into my experiences growing up Catholic and queer, I aim to reflect on the internal turmoil and contradictions that come with loving another.</p>

                    <p>While brainstorming for my project I read the phrase by <a class="underline text-hover-50" href="https://archive.is/VCshZ" target="_blank">Jorge Luis Borges (important note in response to Borges' views on race and culture)</a>, one of Argentina's well known writers, I chose it because at the time I found myself at a crossroads between my upbringing and my newly found queerness. Having never been baptized in a deeply Catholic country and culture, I grew up with immense guilt and shame. From a young age I had a security in my heart that no matter what I would end up in hell, and it terrified me.
                    
                    I decided to take a look at some of the major religions both in real life and fiction, in search of a thread connecting them all. I ultimately narrowed it down to the five steps mentioned above and focused on what each would look like in my love cosmology. In this way the zine works not only as a guide but as a form of reflection and acceptance of the complicated nature of human love.</p>

                            <p><a class="underline text-hover-50" href="https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2023/10/lifestyle-nc-zine-culture" target="_blank">Zines</a> have a long history that is deeply tied to the "Do It Yourself"  movement and to the creation and spread of knowledge within communities blocked from participating in mainstream media. They can take many forms and play many roles, which is why I chose it as a medium for this project. Although the actual steps might be vague, working on this project ultimately helped me accept that ultimately loving others includes the vulnerability of the potential of hurting. When you build someone up in your mind to such heights, things are bound to fall with a tremor, and that is okay.</p>
                            <h3 class="font-bold text-right py-4 text-2xl">FALSE GODS AND IDOLS</h3>
                            <p>One of my earliest memories in church is of an oil painting inspired by Ignacio de Loyola's descriptions of hell on a wall at <a class="underline text-hover-50" href="https://www.wmf.org/monuments/la-compa%C3%B1ia-church" target="_blank">La Compañía de Jesús</a> (pictured above/left). Part of Quito's Siete Cruces, the church started construction on 1605 at the "Centro Histórico" and still stands with its golden dome. The painting is fairly big and portrays sinners being tortured by devils. It gave me something to really fear back then. It also set a thematic and stylistic precedent in my art.</p>

            </div>
                <p>After defining the target audience, I conducted a survey to understand the current perception of the newsletter. The survey was sent to 100 current donors and partners, and the results were as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>60% of respondents found the newsletter "informative"</li>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>After implementing the new design, the newsletter saw an increase in engagement:</p>
