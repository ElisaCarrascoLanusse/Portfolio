            <p class="text-lg my-4">First conceived as part of a zine project for one of my art courses, Theology of Love delves into Borges' quote and explores the realities of love in the 21st century through five steps:</p>
            <ol class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-base font-bold" id="theology-list">
                <li>Belief in the supernatural</li>
                <li>The sacred and the profane</li>
                <li>Rituals</li>
                <li>Place of worship</li>
                <li>Prayer and other forms of communication</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-lg font-medium my-4">The project is meant to emulate a step by step manual to falling in love, and in the process creating a cult with a "fallible god". Delving into my experiences growing up Catholic and queer, I aim to reflect on the internal turmoil and contradictions that come with loving another.</p>

                <h2>Conceptualization</h2>
                <p>Initially inspired by Jorge Luis Borges, one of Latin America's great writers, I chose the phrase because I found myself at a crossroads between my upbringing and my newly found queerness. Having never been baptized in a deeply Catholic country and culture, I grew up with immense guilt and shame. From a young age I had a security in my heart that no matter what I would end up in hell, and it terrified me.
                    
                I decided to take a look at some of the major religions both in real life and fiction, in search of a thread connecting them all. I ultimately narrowed it down to the five steps mentioned above and focused on what each would look like in my love cosmology. In this way the zine works not only as a guide but as a form of reflection and acceptance of the complicated nature of human love.</p>

                <p>The research process begun by  defining the target audience. The Partnerships team works directly with donors and partners, so based on this I created three user personas:</p>
            </div>
                <p>After defining the target audience, I conducted a survey to understand the current perception of the newsletter. The survey was sent to 100 current donors and partners, and the results were as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>60% of respondents found the newsletter "informative"</li>
                    <li>30% of respondents found the newsletter "engaging"</li>
                    <li>10% of respondents found the newsletter "confusing"</li>

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>Based on the research, I worked on a new design for the newsletter. The design focused on improving the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Visual hierarchy</li>
            <li>Content organization</li>
            <li>Call to action</li>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>After implementing the new design, the newsletter saw an increase in engagement:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The average open rate increased to 35.10%</li>
            <li>The average click rate increased to 7.50%</li>
            <li>The average unsubscribing rate decreased to 1.04%</li>
